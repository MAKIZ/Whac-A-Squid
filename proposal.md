# Whack-A-Squid Proposal

## What is Whack-A-Squid?

It is based on the arcade game Whack-A-Mole. Once the game starts, the squids will begin to pop up from their holes at random. The object of the game is to force the individual squid back into their holes by hitting them directly with the cursor, thereby adding to the player's score. The quicker this is done the higher the final score will be.

(Your wireframes go here. Preferably two or more)

## Initial thoughts on game structure

Challenges you expect to encounter:
- How to move down the squid when clicked. creating set interval when the squids will show up
- creating a timer when to stop the game and restart
- adding score and showing highest score

Ideas want to come up with:
- Do bonus round like the squids will show up at the same time and giving the player time to hit all
- Adding special squids that will give extra points. like the squid is glowing 
- Add a boss round where a big squid will show up and needs to hit multiple times and will show up and down fast

## Phases of Completion

1. Finish the wireframe and Mock up by Tuesday - July 11
2. Start working with the HTML and CSS. creating images in Ps or Ai by Wednesday - July 12
3. Start working with Javascript by Thursday - July 13
